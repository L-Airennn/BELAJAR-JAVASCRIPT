# Syntax rule for Arrays
1. Start with the "[" and end with "]"
2. Inside we can put a list of values, and separate each with a comma ",". We can also write array on multiplr line like this:

const myArray = [
  10,         =>index 0
  20,         =>index 1
  30          =>index 2
  ];

to get a value inside the array, we can use the "[]", like: 

console.log (myArray[1]);

number "[1]" is called the index, it represent the position in the array that we want to get. Inside an array we can type any type of value.

- An array itself is also a value, that means we can save the array in variable like this:  

const myArray = [
  10,         =>index 0
  20,         =>index 1
  30          =>index 2
  ];

or even save it in an array like this:

[1, 'hello', true, {'socks'},[1, 2]];

3. because array are just the type of an object, Array also have properties and methods. 

- One useful properties is called ".length", example:

console.log(myArray.length);

- next useful methodd of an array is, called ".push()", this methods adds a value to the end of the array. example:

myArray.push(100); // this will add the 100 to the end of variable myArray

- the last method is called ".splice()"
this removes a value from an array, a splice takes two numbers.
  1.index we want to remove for example:
  2. Number of values to remove

  myArray.splice(0, 2);

  this code will remove the value of "10" and "20"

  

for example:

myArray.splice();






<script>
  const myArray = [10, 20, 30];
  console.log(myArray);

  console.log(myArray[1]);
  myArray[0] = 99;
  console.log(myArray);
</script>
